            <h2>Review Questions & Answers</h2>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>1. What is the meaning of the term "computer"?</h3><p>A computer is an electronic machine that processes data to produce meaningful information. The term "computer" originates from the Latin word "computere," which means "to calculate."</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>2. Explain the working principle of a computer.</h3><p>A computer follows the IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle. It receives data through input devices, processes it using a CPU, and provides output through output devices.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>3. List and describe the major characteristics of a computer.</h3><p>Computers are accurate, fast, reliable, multitasking, and capable of storing large amounts of data. They work tirelessly and follow automated instructions.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>4. What is the importance of storage in a computer?</h3><p>Storage is crucial for saving and retrieving data. Computers use primary (RAM) and secondary storage (HDD, SSD) to store information temporarily and permanently.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>5. Explain the GIGO concept in computing.</h3><p>GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) means that a computer's output quality depends on the accuracy of the input. Incorrect data results in incorrect output.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>6. What are the basic units of a computer system?</h3><p>Basic units include Input Unit, Processing Unit (CPU), Memory Unit, Output Unit, and Storage Unit.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>7. What is an operating system?</h3><p>An operating system is software that manages hardware resources and provides services for applications.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>8. Define hardware and software.</h3><p>Hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer, while software is the set of programs and data that instruct the hardware to perform tasks.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>9. What is the function of RAM and ROM?</h3><p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is volatile memory used for temporary data storage. ROM (Read-Only Memory) stores permanent data needed for booting the computer.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>10. What are input and output devices?</h3><p>Input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse) send data to the computer, while output devices (e.g., monitor, printer) display or produce results.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>11. What is a microprocessor?</h3><p>A microprocessor is the brain of a computer, executing instructions to perform operations.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>12. What is the difference between system software and application software?</h3><p>System software includes operating systems and utilities, whereas application software consists of programs designed for specific tasks like word processing or gaming.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>13. What is cloud computing?</h3><p>Cloud computing refers to delivering computing services like storage and processing over the internet.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>14. What are the types of memory in a computer?</h3><p>Primary memory (RAM, ROM) and secondary memory (HDD, SSD) store and retrieve data.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>15. What is the difference between a bit and a byte?</h3><p>A bit is the smallest unit of data, representing 0 or 1, while a byte consists of 8 bits.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>16. What is artificial intelligence?</h3><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines to perform tasks like learning and problem-solving.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>17. What is machine learning?</h3><p>Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>18. What are the generations of computers?</h3><p>Computers have evolved through five generations, from vacuum tube-based systems to modern AI-integrated machines.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>19. What is an algorithm?</h3><p>An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or perform a task.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>20. What is a programming language?</h3><p>A programming language is a set of instructions used to write software programs (e.g., Python, Java, C++).</p></div>
