            <h2>Chapter 3: Data Representation & Boolean Logic</h2>
            <p>This chapter introduces essential concepts related to data representation in computers. It explains how computers use binary numbers (0s and 1s) to process and store information.</p>
            <p>Key topics include number systems such as decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal, and how to convert between them. The chapter also covers how different types of data, like numbers, text, and images, are represented in memory. Additionally, Boolean logic, which plays a critical role in decision-making within computers, is introduced.</p>

            <h2>Review Questions & Answers</h2>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>1. What is binary representation?</h3><p>Binary representation is a number system using only 0s and 1s to store and process data.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>2. Explain the importance of number systems in computing.</h3><p>Computers rely on number systems (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal) to process and store data efficiently.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>3. What are the different types of number systems?</h3><p>The main types are decimal (base 10), binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16).</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>4. How do you convert decimal to binary?</h3><p>To convert decimal to binary, repeatedly divide by 2 and record the remainders in reverse order.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>5. What is Boolean logic?</h3><p>Boolean logic is a form of algebra that uses true/false values and logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) for decision-making.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>6. What are logic gates?</h3><p>Logic gates are digital circuits that perform Boolean functions like AND, OR, NOT, XOR.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>7. What is ASCII and why is it important?</h3><p>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard for representing text in computers.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>8. What is Unicode?</h3><p>Unicode is a universal character encoding system that supports multiple languages and symbols.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>9. Explain the difference between RAM and ROM.</h3><p>RAM is volatile memory used for temporary storage, while ROM is non-volatile memory containing permanent instructions.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>10. What is a truth table?</h3><p>A truth table is a table that shows the output of a logic function for all possible input combinations.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>11. What is hexadecimal notation used for?</h3><p>Hexadecimal is used in memory addressing and color representation in computing.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>12. What is an example of a real-world Boolean logic application?</h3><p>Boolean logic is used in search engines, circuit design, and decision-making systems.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>13. How does a NOT gate work?</h3><p>A NOT gate inverts the input, outputting the opposite value (1 becomes 0, and vice versa).</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>14. How is data stored in a computer?</h3><p>Data is stored using binary representation in storage devices such as HDDs, SSDs, and RAM.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>15. What is the difference between analog and digital data?</h3><p>Analog data is continuous, while digital data is discrete and represented using binary values.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>16. What is floating-point representation?</h3><p>Floating-point representation is used to store real numbers in scientific notation for precision.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>17. What are combinational circuits?</h3><p>Combinational circuits perform logical operations where output depends only on current inputs.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>18. What are sequential circuits?</h3><p>Sequential circuits use memory to store past input states, affecting future outputs.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>19. What is a half adder and a full adder?</h3><p>A half adder adds two bits, while a full adder adds three bits (including carry).</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>20. Why do computers use binary instead of decimal?</h3><p>Computers use binary because it simplifies circuit design and reduces errors in digital systems.</p></div>
