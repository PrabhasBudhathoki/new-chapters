            <h2>Chapter 2: Computer System Organization</h2>
            <p>This chapter introduces the fundamentals of Computer System Organization, covering the basic structure of a computer, including the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, input/output devices, and storage systems. It emphasizes the role of hardware and software in executing tasks and the interaction between different components of the computer system.</p>
            <p>The chapter also explains binary representation, which is crucial for understanding how data is processed by computers. Key concepts like data representation, logic gates, and the function of the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) are introduced to provide a solid foundation for more advanced topics in computer science.</p>

            <h2>Review Questions & Answers</h2>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>1. What are the main components of a computer system?</h3><p>The main components include the CPU, memory (RAM & ROM), input devices, output devices, and storage devices.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>2. What is the function of the Central Processing Unit (CPU)?</h3><p>The CPU processes instructions, performs calculations, and controls other hardware components.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>3. What are input and output devices? Give examples.</h3><p>Input devices (keyboard, mouse) send data to the computer, while output devices (monitor, printer) display results.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>4. What is primary memory? How is it different from secondary memory?</h3><p>Primary memory (RAM, ROM) is used for temporary storage, while secondary memory (HDD, SSD) is used for long-term storage.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>5. Explain the role of the ALU in a computer.</h3><p>The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) performs arithmetic and logical operations in the CPU.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>6. What is binary representation?</h3><p>Binary representation is a number system that uses only 0s and 1s to store and process data.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>7. What are logic gates?</h3><p>Logic gates are basic electronic circuits that perform logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>8. Define system software and application software.</h3><p>System software (OS, utilities) manages hardware, while application software (MS Word, browsers) helps users perform tasks.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>9. What is cache memory?</h3><p>Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory inside the CPU that stores frequently used data for faster processing.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>10. Explain the function of the motherboard.</h3><p>The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all components of a computer.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>11. What is the difference between volatile and non-volatile memory?</h3><p>Volatile memory (RAM) loses data when power is off, whereas non-volatile memory (ROM, HDD) retains data.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>12. What is firmware?</h3><p>Firmware is pre-installed software stored in ROM that helps hardware function properly.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>13. What are buses in a computer system?</h3><p>Buses are communication pathways that transfer data between CPU, memory, and peripherals.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>14. Explain the role of the control unit in the CPU.</h3><p>The control unit directs data flow, fetches instructions, and manages execution.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>15. What is the difference between HDD and SSD?</h3><p>HDDs use spinning disks for storage, while SSDs use flash memory, making them faster and more reliable.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>16. What is an operating system?</h3><p>An operating system manages computer hardware and software resources (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS).</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>17. What is the function of the BIOS?</h3><p>The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) initializes hardware and loads the operating system.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>18. What is the role of virtual memory?</h3><p>Virtual memory extends RAM by using disk space to store overflow data temporarily.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>19. What is a computer network?</h3><p>A computer network is a system of connected devices that share resources and information.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>20. What are the different types of storage devices?</h3><p>Storage devices include HDDs, SSDs, USB flash drives, SD cards, and cloud storage.</p></div>
