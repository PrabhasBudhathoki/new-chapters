            <h2>Chapter 5: Programming Concepts and Logics</h2>
            <p>This chapter introduces fundamental programming concepts and logical structures. It covers problem-solving approaches, algorithms, flowcharts, and basic programming principles. Students will learn about variables, data types, operators, control structures, and the importance of structured programming.</p>
            <p>The chapter also explains debugging techniques and the significance of programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++ in software development.</p>

            <h2>Review Questions & Answers</h2>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>1. What is programming?</h3><p>Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can execute to perform a specific task.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>2. What are the main components of a programming language?</h3><p>Programming languages consist of syntax, semantics, and a compiler or interpreter to execute the code.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>3. What is an algorithm?</h3><p>An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem logically and efficiently.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>4. What is a flowchart?</h3><p>A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm using symbols to depict the flow of control.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>5. What are variables in programming?</h3><p>Variables are named storage locations in memory used to store data values during program execution.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>6. What are the different data types?</h3><p>Common data types include integers, floats, characters, strings, and booleans.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>7. What is a conditional statement?</h3><p>A conditional statement (if-else) allows a program to make decisions based on conditions.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>8. What are loops in programming?</h3><p>Loops (for, while, do-while) allow repeated execution of code based on a condition.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>9. What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?</h3><p>A compiler translates the entire program before execution, while an interpreter translates and executes line by line.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>10. What is debugging?</h3><p>Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors in a program.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>11. What are operators in programming?</h3><p>Operators perform operations on variables, including arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operations.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>12. What is an array?</h3><p>An array is a data structure used to store multiple values of the same data type.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>13. What are functions in programming?</h3><p>Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>14. What is recursion?</h3><p>Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>15. What is object-oriented programming (OOP)?</h3><p>OOP is a programming paradigm based on objects and classes, supporting concepts like inheritance and encapsulation.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>16. What is the difference between syntax and logic errors?</h3><p>Syntax errors occur due to incorrect code structure, while logic errors result in incorrect program output.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>17. What is the role of a main() function in C++ or Java?</h3><p>The main() function serves as the entry point for program execution.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>18. What are predefined and user-defined functions?</h3><p>Predefined functions come with programming languages, while user-defined functions are created by programmers.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>19. What is an IDE?</h3><p>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) provides tools like a text editor, compiler, and debugger for programming.</p></div>
            <div class="question-box"><h3>20. Why is structured programming important?</h3><p>Structured programming improves code readability, maintainability, and reduces errors by following a logical program structure.</p></div>
